# A Rule Based Recommender System for Indian Elderly Diabetic Population - Research
Recommender system though popularly used in E-commerce applications to provide a unique experience for a diverse demographic, are also extensively used in healthcare. This paper aims to explore incentives for a diet recommender system and understand the possible prospects. Our study includes a literature survey of various diet recommender systems and proposes a new model for recommending foods for Indian elderly patients ailing from diabetes. Constraint-based recommender systems play an essential role in our analysis and focus on a rule-based approach while selecting the type of food that must be suggested based on the Glycemic Index(GI). We also elucidate on our data gathering process as our requirements are definitive, and finally, we proceed to demonstrate our results on our proposed model's performance.
